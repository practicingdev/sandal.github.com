_My efforts on [Mendicant University](http://university.rubymendicant.com) as well as my work on various open source projects and educational initiatives are made possible by the many folks in the Ruby community who [support my work](/support.html) so that I can keep doing what I'm doing._

After several months of radio silence, it's probably about time for me to start doing these progress reports again. I didn't stop because I was bored of writing these status updates, but instead because I have been badly overcommitted and a bit burned out. For the last several months, I have been working mostly on [Practicing Ruby](http://practicingruby.com) with all of my remaining free time being dedicated to [Mendicant University](http://mendicantuniversity.org).

The work on Practicing Ruby has been well worth it. As of right now, I have 285 paying subscribers. The money that the service brings in, along with the [Mendicant Supporters](http://majesticseacreature.com/network.html) program and my wife's income puts us in a reasonable stable position financially. The current cashflow won't help us build up our savings or pay for things like trips to conferences, but it will pretty much make sure that our bills are paid and that we can eat well. While the time commitment I'm currently putting into Practicing Ruby is more than what I would like, it is more stable than consulting work and more directly beneficial to my work on Mendicant University.

In the last four months, I've written somewhere between 150-200 pages of content for Practicing Ruby Volume 2, all of which I plan to release under a Creative Commons license within the next few months, probably some time in March. Work on Volume 3 will begin on January 3rd, and I am looking forward to raising the bar even further in 2012. My work on Practicing Ruby has reminded me just how much I enjoy research and writing, even if it can be a real time sink.  

It is difficult to summarize what has happened at Mendicant University over the last few months, and so I won't try to do that here. All in all, we had a great fall trimester, and we had a chance to try out a lot of new ideas, many of which worked out well.
