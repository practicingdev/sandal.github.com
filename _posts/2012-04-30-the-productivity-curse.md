We live in a world in which the "Better... Faster... Cheaper..." mindset
has transformed from a noble aspiration into a cultural expectation. As a 
result, something that was once considered a triumph of post-industrial
society has mutated into a debilitating mind-virus. This poisonous line of
thinking has caused our producers to become increasingly weary and our 
consumers to become more and more ravenous by the day. The surprising thing
is not the extreme damage this vicious cycle has done; it is our tendency 
to line up willingly to help keep the machine running.

While human plight has been with us throughout history, it is
astonishing to see what an elaborate prison our so-called free society 
has built for itself. Most of our workers spend well over half of their 
waking hours trading their time for money, slaving away at tasks that they 
would rarely choose to spend their time on if they were not getting paid 
for it. The money from this work is then used to pay for basic necessities such
as food, clothing, and shelter; all of which come at an incredibly high cost now
that our traditional economies have been for the most part replaced by the
global market. 

For most families, the income they receive from their commercial
work is not enough to cover their basic survival needs. Rather than turning to
friends and neighbors for help, it is now possible (and easy) to borrow money
from gigantic, faceless banks who will gladly extend credit to pretty much
anyone who asks for it, as long as they can skim enough off the top to make the
transaction lucrative. But because people tend to be so worn down by their day
jobs, they end up wanting more than to simply survive. To experience more
leisure and comfort in life, they borrow more and more so that they can get
bigger and better toys to distract themselves from their mundane labor.

Some folks are smart enough to see this tarpit from a distance, and decide that
they would rather not get caught in it. So they decide they want to get a leg up
on the game by starting their own business, or by going to school.
Unfortunately, this too comes at a high cost and in practice means more loans,
and even more wage labor until they can get themselves established. There are
other options for finding funding for these kinds of efforts, but most of them
either come with just as many strings attached, or are little more than
glorified lotteries. No matter how you look at it, there is no way to raise your
own status in life without someone else profiting off of it in the current
system.

The lucky folks who do end up rising above the run-of-the-mill wage work that
most of our society is tied up in eventually find out that the grass always
looks greener on the other side. As the transition is made from consumer to
producer, the producer comes to realize that the population they serve is
attention-starved due to their lack of available time, ruthlessly economizing
due to their lack of available money that they can truly call their own, and
painfully demanding because of their lack of satisfaction with everyday life.
Thus, the "Better... Faster... Cheaper..." mindset becomes the new reality that
the producer must live or die by, no matter what the cost is. This often leads
producers to create the exact same working environment they had strived to get
away from in the first place.

In this twisted world, the only winners are loan sharks and racketeers, who form
a very small percentage of the population and do not need to exert all that much
force to get people to play their game. While these individuals and institutions
go to great lengths to extend their reach and perpetuate their own existence,
they can rightly say that most folks can and do come to them of their own free
will. As a result, most of our atrocities and inhumanities can be blamed on
well-intentioned, hard working people who are just trying to get by in a system
that is set up to work against them. This leads us to point fingers at one
another rather than realize that we are all in the same struggle together, and
that this is the weakness that truly evil men prey on.

The true tragedy of our lust for increased productivity is that we are only
accelerating our own demise. If we took a closer look at the world and came to
realize that we could direct the "Better... Faster.. Cheaper" mindset at our
most basic human needs, we would rapidly change our lives for the better. It is
not idealistic to envision a world in which affordable housing and wholesome
food is available to all people without so much struggle. Instead, it is a precondition
for unlocking the true innovative potential that exists within every soul.

If we could only remember why we learned to be productive in the first place, we 
might focus less on creating the next FarmVille and instead focus on how to 
make better farms. Rather than lusting after creating a social network with
billions of "users" to force-feed advertisements to, we might focus instead
on rebuilding our real world social networks that once helped us raise 
our children and build our houses. This would not be a step back to a more
primitive time, but instead, a conscious decision to finally use the massive
machine we built to serve its original intended purpose.

To sum this all up in a much more concise way: **It is not our ability to be
productive that counts, it is what we do with it!**
