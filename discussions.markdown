<p style="font-size: 0.9em">If you happen to spot me at a conference, try to make sure you're not accidentally talking to Chap Ambrose. This can be especially difficult, as we've impersonated each other in the past.</p>

<p>For quick questions or comments, you can tweet something to <a
href="http://twitter.com/seacreature">@seacreature</a>.
However, twitter is a poor conversation format. I'd much prefer it if you
write a blog post and then send me a link, or if you catch up with me
via Freenode. Just send a message to <b>seacreature</b> in the
<b>#mendicant</b> channel.</p>

<p>If you want to talk to me in private, you can email me at
<b>gregory.t.brown@gmail.com</b>, but please keep in mind my inbox is very busy and
it might take me some time to get back to you. For the most part,
I tend to respond to every email I receive within a couple days.</p>
