<p>I recently stopped having conversations on Twitter, and developed a distaste for
blog comments. I also try to stay off Hacker News and Reddit for the most part,
because they are insanely distracting to me. That said, I'm not nearly as much
of an internet hermit as it seems, and love to have conversations with
folks who are interested in the things I'm interested in.</p>

<p>If you want to talk to me in private, you can email me at
gregory.t.brown@gmail.com, but please keep in mind my inbox is very busy and
it might take me some time to get back to you. If you want to discuss things
in public, you can either blog a response to something I've said and email me
a link, or find me on IRC in either the #rmu or #seacreature channel.</p>
