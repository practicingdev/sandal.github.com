<p>For quick questions or comments, you can tweet something to @seacreature.
However, twitter is a poor conversation format. I'd much prefer it if you
wrote a blog post and then sent me the link, or if you'd catch up with me
over Freenode. I am seacreature there and you can always find me in the
#mendicant channel</p>

<p>If you want to talk to me in private, you can email me at
gregory.t.brown@gmail.com, but please keep in mind my inbox is very busy and
it might take me some time to get back to you.</p>
