The Ruby Mendicant Supporter Network is a way for those who appreciate my work on [Mendicant University](http://university.rubymendicant.com) and various open source projects to help me work on volunteer efforts nearly full time. This gives me a way to keep doing what I'm doing without the stress of balancing my time with consulting gigs, and without giving up any creative control or branding to corporate sponsors or employees.

Here's how it works: If you give me $4, $8, $16, or $32 a month, that gets applied directly to covering my living expenses. This reduces the amount of commercial work I need to do, which makes it possible for me to spend more and more time on my community-oriented projects. In return, I will give you access to a mailing list where you can meet up with other supporters of mine. On that mailing list, I occasionally give my supporters early access to various things I'm working on as a way of saying thanks for their contributions. I also am happy to do a code review every once in a while, or otherwise help out those who are helping me.

While you won't be able to tell me exactly what to work on, and you shouldn't expect to get anything specific in return for your contributions, you'll certainly be part of a group that I regularly consider feedback from. I know that those who are willing to invest in me care enough about my projects to want to see them succeed, and so I try to keep an open ear to whatever my supporters have to say.

If you want to be a part of this experiment, please subscribe via the PayPal form below. If you do so, you'll be joining over 75 others who have already taken the plunge. So far, we've only had two folks cancel their subscriptions, and I've been doing this since the beginning of May 2011.

If you have any questions about this program, email me at gregory.t.brown@gmail.com.

If you'd prefer to offer me some financial support in a slightly less unorthodox way, you can join my [Practicing Ruby newsletter](http://practicingruby.com) and get something specific in return for the money you give me.
