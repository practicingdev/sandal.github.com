<hr>

Since early 2011, I have been accepting financial support in the form of small
monthly payments to support my work on <a
href="http://mendicantuniversity.org">Mendicant University</a> as well as my open
source projects. These contributions have made my life much easier, especially
when I was in the process of transitioning away from consulting work to focusing
entirely on writing and teaching.

Now that the <a href="http://practicingruby.com">Practicing Ruby</a> journal is
almost ramen-sustainable, I'd prefer if those who want to support my work would
simply become a subscriber there instead of giving me direct monthly payments.
This way, you'll get something in return while still helping me out quite a bit.

However, some folks may want to pay me larger or smaller amounts, and might need
to use PayPal instead of Amazon Payments to do so. If that is the case for you,
feel free to set up a subscription below.
