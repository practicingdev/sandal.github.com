<p>So, you think what I'm doing is valuable and want to help me keep doing it.
Awesome!</p>

<p>The easiest way to support me is by becoming a subscriber of my <a
href="http://practicingruby.com">Practicing Ruby</a> journal. This will help me
financially while giving you access to some of my best articles months
before they becomes publicly available.</p>

<p>If you instead would prefer to help me out generally without expecting
anything in return, you could alternatively join 
my <a href="http://majesticseacreature.com/support.html">supporter network</a>.
 Small monthly gifts from Ruby community members have helped both
 Mendicant University and Practicing Ruby stay afloat since early
 2011.</p>
