with no conditions attached and are made out directly to me ;-)</p>

<p>So, you think what I'm doing is valuable and want to help me keep doing it.
Awesome!</p>

<p>Joining my <a href="/network.html">supporter network</a> is the best and 
most direct way to help. Small monthly payments from many people add up 
to a monthly revenue stream that helps me maintain my standard of living 
while I work mostly on volunteer projects. In return, my supporters get 
early access to various things I'm working on, as well as some other perks.</p>

<p>Does that sound too much like some sort of hippy scheme to you? If so,
consider subscribing to the <a href="http://practicingruby.com">Practicing Ruby
newsletter</a>. This way, you still can support me financially while getting 
something specific in return.</p>
